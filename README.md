Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Using Vibration Signal Spectrograms and Explainable AI Techniques

This research implements and evaluates an automated machine learning approach for gearbox fault diagnosis focusing on binary classification (healthy vs. faulty) using features extracted from vibration signals. The study utilizes a dataset comprising 6428 samples (3200 positive/faulty， 3228 negative/healthy) with 8 statistical and frequency-domain features extracted from vibration signals. The LazyClassifier technique is employed to automatically evaluate and compare multiple machine learning models without extensive manual configuration. The ExtraTreesClassifier emerges as the top performer with 87% accuracy， while LightGBM， Random Forest， XGBoost， and SVC demonstrate comparable performance at 86%. The research highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of automated model selection for gearbox fault diagnosis， making it particularly valuable for practical predictive maintenance applications. The results confirm that ensemble-based methods， particularly tree-based ensembles， are highly effective for this specific diagnostic task， achieving high accuracy with minimal manual tuning.
